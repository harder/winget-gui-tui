> ⚠️ **Proof of concept — for evaluation only.** This project exists to **benchmark Terminal.Gui v2 against Ratatui**: feature parity, rendering fidelity, performance, and UX. It is not a finished application, is not on a release track, and is not intended for daily use. Run it on a Windows machine with `winget` only if you understand that **install / uninstall / upgrade actions invoke the real `winget` CLI** and will operate on your real package state.

A C# / [Terminal.Gui](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui) v2 reimplementation of [shanselman/winget-tui](https://github.com/shanselman/winget-tui) — a Rust + Ratatui TUI for the Windows Package Manager.

## Origin & attribution

This is a from-scratch C# / Terminal.Gui v2 port of [**shanselman/winget-tui**](https://github.com/shanselman/winget-tui) — Scott Hanselman's Rust + Ratatui TUI for the Windows Package Manager. Copyright © Scott Hanselman, MIT-licensed.

UI layout, keybindings, color palette, table structure, winget output parsing, dedupe / pin-state / locale handling, and the "Found `<name>` [`<id>`]" detail-header convention all follow the [upstream source](https://github.com/shanselman/winget-tui/tree/main/src). **No upstream code was copied** — the upstream served as the behavioral and visual specification.

Differences between the two implementations — including Terminal.Gui feature gaps surfaced while porting — are documented in [feature-gaps.md](feature-gaps.md).

## Building

`winget` itself is Windows-only, so the deployed target is Windows. The build uses **.NET
Native AOT** to produce a single standalone `.exe` (~10–15 MB) that runs without `dotnet`
installed on the target machine — matching the upstream Rust binary's deployment story.

### Prerequisites

You must build on a **Windows host** — Native AOT does not support cross-OS publish (a
Linux/WSL `dotnet publish` for `win-x64` or `win-arm64` will fail with "Cross-OS native
compilation is not supported"). Architecture cross-targeting *between* the two Windows
RIDs works fine, so you don't need an ARM machine to produce an arm64 build.

- **Windows host** (any architecture — see arch cross-compile note below)
- **.NET 10 SDK** ([install](https://dot.net))
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** with the *Desktop development with C++* workload
  (the AOT linker uses MSVC's `link.exe` and the Windows SDK).
- To produce an **arm64** binary, also install the **MSVC v143 — VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build
  tools** component (works from x64 or arm64 hosts).

### Build the standalone executable

The architecture you build for must match where the binary will run:

| Target Windows machine | Command |
|------------------------|---------|
| Intel / AMD x64 (most Windows PCs) | `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64` |
| ARM64 (Surface Pro X, Snapdragon Copilot+ PCs, Windows Dev Kit) | `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-arm64` |

```powershell
# x64 (Intel/AMD)
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
.\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\publish\winget-tui-gui.exe

# arm64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-arm64
.\bin\Release\net10.0\win-arm64\publish\winget-tui-gui.exe
```

**Cross-architecture compile** (`x64 → arm64` or `arm64 → x64`) works on Windows as long
as the matching VS C++ build tools component is installed. Building on Windows arm64
produces an arm64 exe that runs natively (no x64 emulation).

Copy `winget-tui-gui.exe` anywhere — no other files required.

### Dev iteration on any host (including WSL / macOS / Linux)

For iterating on the code, `dotnet run` is faster than re-publishing AOT each time, and
unlike the AOT publish it works on any OS — handy for hacking on the UI from WSL. There's
no `winget` to invoke on non-Windows hosts, so use `--mock`:

```bash
dotnet run                  # Windows: hits real winget
dotnet run -- --mock        # any host: mock backend, useful for UI development
```

### Run the test suite

```bash
dotnet test tests/WingetTui.Tests.csproj
```

The xUnit suite under `tests/` covers:

- **Parser pipeline** — table parsing, ANSI/CR handling, display-width column slicing for
  CJK, dedupe with version-first preference, footer stop and secondary-table parsing,
  bad-id rejection, store product ids, ARP\Machine\… ids, truncated ids, digit-prefixed
  package names.
- **`winget show`** — Found-line extraction, locale-independent prefix (German `Gefunden`),
  multi-line description continuation, German keys, bracketed release-notes don't hijack
  the Found-line detector, homepage / publisher_url fallback, release-notes-url
  extraction.
- **CLI argument construction** — install/upgrade-by-id don't include `--exact`,
  upgrade-by-name does, pin add uses `--blocking`, pin remove avoids `--installed`,
  upgrade includes `--include-pinned`, list doesn't.
- **Pin state precedence** — Blocking trumps all, Gating(version), `"latest"` is Pinned
  not Gating, empty inputs degrade to None.
- **Models** — `Package.IsTruncated`, `PinState.DisplayLabel`,
  `PackageDetail.MergeContext`, `EnsureDetailHint`.
- **Version comparison** — numeric vs lexical, longer-prefix-wins, empty handling.
- **Terminal.Gui compatibility** — `Theme.Register` round-trip, every named scheme
  resolves, `Rune.GetColumns()` returns 2 for CJK and 1 for ASCII, `string.GetColumns()`
  walks grapheme clusters correctly, `Logo` instantiates with expected dimensions,
  `TabBar` reports clicks via `TabClicked`, `MarkedTableSource` nested type still exists.
  These catch breakages on Terminal.Gui version upgrades.

Every test is anchored to a real bug found during development or a Terminal.Gui surface
we depend on; **73 tests**, runs in <1 second.

### Diagnose winget parser issues at runtime

The `--dump` mode invokes winget and prints the raw output plus a parser trace. Useful
when real `winget` output doesn't match what the parser expects:

```powershell
winget-tui-gui.exe --dump search vscode
winget-tui-gui.exe --dump list
winget-tui-gui.exe --dump upgrade
winget-tui-gui.exe --dump show --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode --exact
```

9 source files in `src/` matching the upstream Rust project's `src/` layout. ~3,800 LOC total
(upstream is ~3,500 logical lines across 9 `.rs` files).

## Status & roadmap

This is a POC. Things known to be unfinished or different from upstream are listed in [feature-gaps.md](feature-gaps.md). Not under active development beyond what's needed for parity benchmarking. PRs that close parity gaps are welcome.

Things explicitly **out of scope**:

- Configuration file support (`%APPDATA%\winget-tui\config.toml`)
- Distribution / packaging (Microsoft Store, MSIX, signed releases)

## Releases

Tag-driven via `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Builds AOT executables for `win-x64` and `win-arm64`, packages each as both a bare `.exe` and a portable `.zip` bundle (exe + README + LICENSE + feature-gaps), computes SHA-256 checksums, and publishes a GitHub Release with all artifacts attached. **Not code-signed** — the upstream Rust version is signed via Azure Trusted Signing; this POC doesn't have that, so first-run SmartScreen warnings on Windows are expected.

Manual dispatch is also available from the Actions tab (provide a `version` input).
